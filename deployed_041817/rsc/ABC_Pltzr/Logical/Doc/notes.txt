Good morning Goran,
Duckhorn has requested a minor change to the machine HMI programming which is:

They want the fault screen to remain displayed and not automatically close when a fault is cleared. They want to manually navigate away from the fault screen.

Unhide the mute button

Change the maintenance access password to 4858418

 
- a logic to automaticaly switch away from the alarm screen when all alarms are cleared is removed. 
Change: file: appHmiLogic.c, line: 1491
- changed the maint access password to 4858418
Change: file: paiUser.c, line: 105
- changed hide logic for safety curtains 'mute' button. Now, the button will be shown even for users that are not logged in.
Change: ladder: palletdischarge Rung: 13

=======
-rectified 'no pallet reset' after executing 'Complete Pallet' manual request
-changed logic for stopping the infeed CV; instead of stopping when staging stops, the infeed CV now stops only when staging is stopped AND case is present at EE2
-changed logic for elevator when exiting pallet; instead of going to top of the pallet, now the elevator goes to the top (max elevator position)
-fixed issue with entering a case command in the layer desinger
-added support for 6th blade
-changed manual operation of the blade stops from time delayed to quick (no time delay)


4/18/2016
==========
DONE-EE2 / EE8 stop the machine row jam/incorrect count
DONE-stage at EE4
DONE-stats timer only in auto mode
-vfd fault indication in the alarm text
DONE-prevent changing counts in automatic
DONE-in automatic can't go to manual screen (put finish product button eslewhere)
-full pallet out should zero the layers
DONE ALARM INCORRECT COUNT
DONE HIDE ZERO BUTTON WHEN in AUTO
VFD BRA = OFF for VFD5 and VFD52

4/15/2016
=========
DONE: Button: load appConfig from file
VFD errors show in the alarm!
Stats counters
Case count
Pallete count
Pallete / hour
Case / min
DONE: Blade stop drawing support
DONE: Move blade stop timers to recipe
Staging cv support
Usb programming
File copy to/from to usb
Factory defaults
Retainer bar early feature
Pallet discharge interlock
Remove unused code, pages, etc
Add stop / resume to ssm.
Add single step support to ssm.


4/14/12016
=========
DONE-moved all timers to recipe
DONE-added pallet exit button (manual mode only)
DONE-added pallet finish button (auto mode only, to finish pallet and discharge)
-

4/13/2015
==========
- zero button visibility check logic (it can cause havoc is pressed when not allowed)
DONE- pallet done (in auto mode, compeltes the pallete and exits it) 
 vs. run pallet out (in manual mode, exits the palette) > buttons needed
STOP BUTTON - shall stop and any time, then resume from there 
PART- debounce timers for all PE-s (EE2, EE4, EE8) > recipe
DONE - product/recipe dependant settings (i.e. timers, etc)
DONE- delay front squearing action using a delay timer
DONE- pallet takeaway timer; the time required for a discharge PE to clear before the pallet are moved to discharge cv forward
- EE8 get the code for it
DONE- row forming VFD speeds and acc, table speed, acc/decl, discrage cv-s > all VDD-s shall be part of the recipe
DONE - defending fault shall be shown as the alarm!! (not low air pressure)
DONE - drop down LF key to jump to screen MANUAL
DONE - the delay time for row push shall be respected after restart following an e-stop on the last case for the row (if the e-stop tiggered just before the last estop made the row, the continue will immedialtly push the 
row wo. waiting)
- Connect Alarm Ack button to the Clear VFD Fault input

3/24/2015
==========
-add alarm for elevator stop block
-add light curtain functionlity - fault and mute
-chain slack alarm recovery from stop block
-add message block stops are down


3/23/2015
=========
-added support for new HW config:
PPC70_JOB24025
-this configuration is according to the ABC JOB24025
-no palletizer dispneser is used. Instead, the pallets are build directly onto the mesh converyer
-the HW changes include:
-added 2 VFD-s VFD52 (row pusher ext) and VFD12 (pallet discharge CV)
-dropped VFD4 (row pusher) and reassinged it as VFD5 (infeed rollers)



3/22/2016
==========
-revisit and rectify recipe handling to have only a single file per recipe (i.e. layer files included in the recipe file)
-DONE-reshuffle recipe screens (i.e. recipe select, recipe create, layer create, layer view, etc)
DONE-add support for multiple blade stops
DONE-add support for pallet dispenser
-add support for infeed conveyer location (left/right) to be reflected on the configuration screen
DONE-rectify issue with the VFD-s at startup (i.e. reboot shall not be required due to incorrect configuration)
-revisti all hmi screens
-test interruptions, e-stops and power outages
-allow elevator jog when table not at grouping (recovery mode!)
-add new alarms
-pattern layer changes require reload of the pattern program to init the structures!!!
