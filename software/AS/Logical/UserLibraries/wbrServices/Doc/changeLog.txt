TODO:
!!! clean up listSvc mem usage!!!
                              - add code to trim e.g. 10% from log lists when mem usage reaches a certain point
                              x - move mem mgt to new lib wbrMemSvc
                              - add code to increase heap block request if usage > e.g. 50%
                              - add code to warn when heap block usage > e.g. 90%

LogSvc                        x - don't use list if status == 0 after first func call
                              x - get rid of fb pointer if possible - keeping but handled better
                              - implement logging level
                              - link multiple messages/events together using Origin
                              - individual logs for libraries
                                - support for upstream services, e.g. listSvc

wbrIOSvc
wbrNetSvc
wbrStrUtil

wbrsprintf                    - try preprocessor trick in header to allow dynamic lib
                                - #ifdef prototypes to prevent use in static lib
                                - add static lib as dependency of dynamic lib
                                - define the token used in #ifdef in dynamic lib so that prototypes are linked there

  Clean up some /todos and other comments

0.10.6  2016-03-31
  Added TimerServices
    Made a few mods to suit Hailo project and be more generic, e.g. msTimer object declared
    Using clock_ms() from AsTime to count milliseconds
    Added msTimer.diff_ms to facilitate time tracking, e.g. "hour meters"
  A few changes to Init and Cyclic to be more generic for multiple projects
    Write compile info to log on Init
  Updated package dependencies to facilitate more trouble-free importing
